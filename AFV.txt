A zebra escapes from the zoo

After a while he arrives at a farm. He finds all sorts of new animals, and curious as he is he feels that he needs to know what sort of place he has come to.

First he sees some sheep eating grass on the field. He asks the sheep what they're doing.

"We are sheep and we grow wool that the farmer can use to make clothes", answers the sheep.

Not far from there he finds a hen pen.

"What are you and what are you doing?", the zebra asks the hen.

"We are hen, we lay eggs that hatch into chickens or is eaten by the farmer", say the hen.

Excited he rushes and asks the cow what she's doing. "I eat the fodder in my bucket and in return I give milk to the farmer and his children", she replies in a sweet voice.

Not far from there, the bull is standing with a mighty posture in a pen overlooking the cows.

"Hey there, striped horse", he shouts with a deep voice.

"Hello there, and who might you be?", the zebra replies. "I'm the bull, I am the strongest and most majestic animal on this farm", the bull says and flexes his muscles to demonstrate his might.

"Oh, impressive! So what do you do around here?

" Take off your pyjamas and I'll show you!
